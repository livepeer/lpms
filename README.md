# LPMS - Livepeer Media Server

LPMS is a media server that can run independently, or on top of the [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org)
network. It allows you to manipulate / broadcast a live video stream. Currently, LPMS supports RTMP
as input format and RTMP/HLS as output formats.

LPMS can be integrated into another service, or run as a standalone service. To try LPMS as a
standalone service, simply get the package:

```sh
go get -d github.com/livepeer/lpms/cmd/example
```

Go to the lpms root directory at `$GOPATH/src/github.com/livepeer/lpms`. If needed, install the required dependencies; see the Requirements section below. Then build the sample app and run it:

```sh
go build cmd/example/main.go
./example
```

### Requirements

LPMS requires libavcodec (ffmpeg) and friends. See `install_ffmpeg.sh` . Running this script will install everything in `~/compiled`. In order to build LPMS, the dependent libraries need to be discoverable by pkg-config and golang. If you installed everything with `install_ffmpeg.sh` , then run `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/compiled/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH` so the deps are picked up.

Running golang unit tests (`test.sh`) requires the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` executables in addition to the libraries. To ensure the executables are available, run `export PATH=~/compiled/bin:$PATH`. Additionally it requires ffmpeg to be build with additional codecs and formats enabled. To build `ffmpeg` with all codecs and formats enabled, ensure `clang` is installed and then run `BUILD_TAGS=debug-video ./install_ffmpeg.sh`. However, none of these are run-time requirements; the executables are not used outside of testing, and the libraries are statically linked by default. Note that dynamic linking may substantially speed up rebuilds if doing heavy development.

### Testing out LPMS

The test LPMS server exposes a few different endpoints:

1. `rtmp://localhost:1935/stream/test` for uploading/viewing RTMP video stream.
2. `http://localhost:7935/stream/test_hls.m3u8` for consuming the HLS video stream.

Do the following steps to view a live stream video:

1. Start LPMS by running `go run cmd/example/main.go`
2. Upload an RTMP video stream to `rtmp://localhost:1935/stream/test`. We recommend using ffmpeg or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download).

   For ffmpeg on osx, run: `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -pixel_format uyvy422 -i "0:0" -c:v libx264 -tune zerolatency -b:v 900k -x264-params keyint=60:min-keyint=60 -c:a aac -ac 2 -ar 44100 -f flv rtmp://localhost:1935/stream/test`

   For OBS, fill in Settings->Stream->URL to be rtmp://localhost:1935

3. If you have successfully uploaded the stream, you should see something like this in the LPMS output

   ```bash
   I0324 09:44:14.639405   80673 listener.go:28] RTMP server got upstream
   I0324 09:44:14.639429   80673 listener.go:42] Got RTMP Stream: test
   ```

4. Now you have a RTMP video stream running, we can view it from the server. Simply run `ffplay http://localhost:7935/stream/test.m3u8`, you should see the hls video playback.

### Integrating LPMS

LPMS exposes a few different methods for customization. As an example, take a look at `cmd/main.go`.

To create a new LPMS server:

```go
// Specify ports you want the server to run on, and the working directory for
// temporary files. See `core/lpms.go` for a full list of LPMSOpts
opts := lpms.LPMSOpts {
    RtmpAddr: "127.0.0.1:1935",
    HttpAddr: "127.0.0.1:7935",
    WorkDir:  "/tmp"
}
lpms := lpms.New(&opts)
```

To handle RTMP publish:

```go
lpms.HandleRTMPPublish(
	//getStreamID
	func(url *url.URL) (strmID string) {
		return getStreamIDFromPath(reqPath)
	},
	//getStream
	func(url *url.URL, rtmpStrm stream.RTMPVideoStream) (err error) {
		return nil
	},
	//finishStream
	func(url *url.URL, rtmpStrm stream.RTMPVideoStream) (err error) {
		return nil
	})
```

To handle RTMP playback:

```go
lpms.HandleRTMPPlay(
	//getStream
	func(ctx context.Context, reqPath string, dst av.MuxCloser) error {
		glog.Infof("Got req: ", reqPath)
		streamID := getStreamIDFromPath(reqPath)
		src := streamDB.db[streamID]
		if src != nil {
			src.ReadRTMPFromStream(ctx, dst)
		} else {
			glog.Error("Cannot find stream for ", streamID)
			return stream.ErrNotFound
		}
		return nil
	})
```

To handle HLS playback:

```go
lpms.HandleHLSPlay(
	//getHLSBuffer
	func(reqPath string) (*stream.HLSBuffer, error) {
		streamID := getHLSStreamIDFromPath(reqPath)
		buffer := bufferDB.db[streamID]
		s := streamDB.db[streamID]

		if s == nil {
			return nil, stream.ErrNotFound
		}

		if buffer == nil {
			//Create the buffer and start copying the stream into the buffer
			buffer = stream.NewHLSBuffer()
			bufferDB.db[streamID] = buffer

            //Subscribe to the stream
			sub := stream.NewStreamSubscriber(s)
			go sub.StartHLSWorker(context.Background())
			err := sub.SubscribeHLS(streamID, buffer)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, stream.ErrStreamSubscriber
			}
		}

		return buffer, nil
	})
```

### GPU Support

Processing on Nvidia GPUs is supported. To enable this capability, FFmpeg needs
to be built with GPU support. See the
[FFmpeg guidelines](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#NVENCNVDEC) on
this.

To execute the nvidia tests within the `ffmpeg` directory, run this command:

```sh
go test --tags=nvidia -run Nvidia

```

To run the tests on a particular GPU, use the GPU_DEVICE environment variable:

```sh
# Runs on GPU number 3
GPU_DEVICE=3 go test --tags=nvidia -run Nvidia
```

Aside from the tests themselves, there is a
[sample program](https://github.com/livepeer/lpms/blob/master/cmd/transcoding/transcoding.go)
that can be used as a reference to the LPMS GPU transcoding API. The sample
program can select GPU or software processing via CLI flags. Run the sample
program via:

```sh
# software processing
go run cmd/transcoding/transcoding.go transcoder/test.ts P144p30fps16x9,P240p30fps16x9 sw

# nvidia processing, GPU number 2
go run cmd/transcoding/transcoding.go transcoder/test.ts P144p30fps16x9,P240p30fps16x9 nv 2
```

### Testing GPU transcoding with failed segments from Livepeer production environment

To test transcoding of segments failed on production in Nvidia environment:

1. Install Livepeer from sources by following the [installation guide](https://docs.livepeer.org/guides/orchestrating/install-go-livepeer#build-from-source)
2. Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
3. Make sure you have access to the bucket with the segments
4. Download the segments:

   ```sh
   gsutil cp -r gs://livepeer-production-failed-transcodes /home/livepeer-production-failed-transcodes
   ```

5. Run the test

   ```sh
   cd transcoder
   FAILCASE_PATH="/home/livepeer-production-failed-transcodes" go test --tags=nvidia -timeout 6h -run TestNvidia_CheckFailCase
   ```

6. After the test has finished, it will display transcoding stats. Per-file results are logged to `results.csv` in the same directory
